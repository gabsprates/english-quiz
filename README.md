# English Quiz

This is a home work from my course. The challenge was make a quiz, like a game show with questions and answers, so I decided write this with React. It was a great opportunity to study and practice a bit of JS.

This is my first React app, after a "hello world", and (still) isn't a SPA. The little backend part it's written in PHP, and the `webservice` directory needs `+rw` permission, as the `perguntas.json` file.


## Todo:

* [ ] To separate the frontend and backend. Take advantage to train more about backend;

* [ ] Run it on a **Node.js** server, in a suitable port;

* [ ] Put **Webpack** tasks on **Grunt**.
